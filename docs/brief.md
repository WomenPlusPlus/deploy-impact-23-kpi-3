## 1. Context

Many (if not all) organisations define goals/OKRs/KPIs. Some of which can't be measured automatically.
Our aim is to avoid evaluating the KPIs in MS Excel.

## 2. Goal

To increase efficiency by streamlining processes for diverse teams/circles, improve data quality and enable data driven decisions,
we need team/circle members are enabled to manually insert KPI values with minimal effort. 
And then values should be visualized in a dashboard.

So, the main goal of the project is to create an app for team/circle members to manually and frequently insert KPI values.
