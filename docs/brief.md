## 1. Context

Many (if not all) organisations define goals/OKRs/KPIs. Some of which can't be measured automatically.
Our aim is to avoid evaluating the KPIs in MS Excel.

## 2. Product vision

Streamlined KPI Analysis: Create an intuitive KPI management app that simplifies data entry and offers powerful data analysis and visualization features. Our primary goal is to provide efficient KPI tracking, with advanced analytics as a potential enhancement.

## 3. Goal

To increase efficiency by streamlining processes for diverse teams/circles, improve data quality and enable data driven decisions,
we need team/circle members are enabled to manually insert KPI values with minimal effort. 
And then values should be visualized in a dashboard.

So, the main goal of the project is to create an app for team/circle members to manually and frequently insert KPI values.
